# NabLab
NabLab is a open-source research project led by [HPC initiative of the CEA](http://www-hpc.cea.fr/index-en.htm). Its aim is to realize a modeling environment for the [Nabla language](http://nabla-lang.org/index.html) to provide a productive development way for exascale HPC technologies, flexible enough to be competitive in terms of performances.

It is composed of:
- an evolution of the Domain Specific Language (DSL) Nabla to improve applied mathematicians productivity throughput and enables new algorithmic developments for the construction of hierarchical and composable high-performance scientific applications. 
- an full-fledged environment to edit, interpret and debug Nabla programs and to generate optimized code for various libraries based on [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

# Motivation
Addressing the major challenges of software productivity and performance portability is becoming necessary to take advantage of emerging extreme-scale computing architectures. As software development costs will continuously increase to address exascale hardware issues, higher-level programming abstraction will facilitate the path to go. There is a growing demand for new programming environments in order to improve scientific productivity, to facilitate the design and implementation, and to optimize large production codes.
